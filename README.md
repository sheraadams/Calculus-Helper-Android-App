## About the Project
This app was programmed with Java in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). It is compiled with SDK 34 and targets SDK 24 - 33. It is a helpful tool for mathematical modeling and for quick conversion between integrals and derivatives. It is inspired from one of [my first projects](https://github.com/sheraadams/Simple-RSA-Mesage-Encryption) which I originally programmed with Python and Tkinter.
